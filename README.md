# mybasemap

## Description:

For this lab, I designed a basemap using the mapping software MapBox. The style I applied was based on the colors of my favorite teams, the Seattle Seahawks, Oregon State Beavers, and Portland Trailblazers. I chose this style because the selected teams are not only my favorite sports teams, but I wanted to see how I could combine each of their colors to make a visually appealing basemap. Most of the map was styled using the Seahawks' main colors, dark blue, lime green, and gray, in which I placed a dark blue background, lime green for forests, park, borders, and buildings, and gray for roads. Since black is a primary color of both the Trailblazers and the Beavers and because it would not be distinguishable with a dark blue backdrop, I did not use that color. However, since the Beavers' and Trailblazers' main colors are orange and red, respectively, I used orange to color schools and red to color hospitals. Water features were represented with sky blue, although it is not a color for any of these three teams.
